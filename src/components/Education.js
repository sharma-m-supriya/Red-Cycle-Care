        <div class="content">When Do Most Girls Get Their Period?</div>
        <div class="answer">                   
        The age at which girls typically get their first period, known as menarche, can vary. In the past, the average age of menarche was around 12 to 13 years old. However, over the last century, there has been a trend toward earlier puberty onset in many parts of the world.<br></br>
        The current average age of menarche in developed countries is around 12 years old, but it can occur anywhere between the ages of 9 and 16. Factors such as genetics, nutritional status, overall health, and environmental factors can influence the timing of menarche.</div>

        <div class="content">What Causes a Period?</div>

        <div class="answer"> A menstrual period, also known as menstruation, is a natural part of the menstrual cycle in females. It is a monthly process that occurs in women of reproductive age. The primary cause of a period is the shedding of the uterine lining, which is no longer needed to support a potential pregnancy.
<br></br>
Menstrual Cycle: The menstrual cycle is a regular sequence of changes that occur in the female reproductive system. It usually lasts about 28 days, but it can vary from person to person.
The menstrual cycle is influenced by various hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, which are produced by the ovaries and the temporary endocrine structures formed during the cycle. It is a complex process orchestrated by the body to prepare for possible pregnancy each month. If pregnancy does occur, menstruation will cease until after childbirth.</div>

<div class="content">How Long Do Periods Last?</div>
<div class="answer">Periods usually last for 5 days,the duration can sometimes be more or less.</div><br></br>
<br></br>
<div class="content">Do Periods Happen Regularly When Menstruation Begins?</div>
<div class="answer">For the first few years after a girl starts menstruating, it may not come regularly. This is normal at first. By about 2–3 years after her first period, a girl's periods should be coming around once every 4–5 weeks.</div>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<div class="content">How Does Ovulation Relate to Periods?</div>
<div class="answer">
Ovulation and periods are both essential components of the menstrual cycle, but they represent distinct phases with different purposes. Understanding the relationship between ovulation and periods is crucial for grasping the entire menstrual cycle process.
<br></br>
Ovulation: Ovulation is the release of a mature egg (ovum) from one of the ovaries. It typically occurs approximately midway through the menstrual cycle, around day 14 in a 28-day cycle.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Relationship between Ovulation and Periods:
<br></br>
Ovulation is a critical event that occurs before menstruation.
<br></br>
Ovulation precedes Menstruation: Ovulation occurs approximately two weeks before menstruation. After ovulation, the released egg can survive for about 24 hours, waiting for fertilization to occur.
Purpose of Menstruation: If fertilization does not happen during the fertile window, the hormone levels (estrogen and progesterone) drop, leading to the shedding of the thickened uterine lining. This is menstruation, which marks the start of a new menstrual cycle.
